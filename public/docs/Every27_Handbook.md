## 8. Salary Advance

### What is Salary Advance?

Salary Advance allows employees to access a portion of their earned salary before the official payday. It's a financial tool designed to help employees manage unexpected expenses.

### How It Works

1. **Employee requests** an advance through their dashboard
2. **System validates** eligibility and amount
3. **Funds are credited** to employee's wallet instantly
4. **On the 27th**, advance + fee is deducted from salary
5. **Remaining salary** is credited to wallet

### Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for salary advance:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Employment Period | Must be on platform for at least 1 month |
| Company Approval | Company must have feature enabled |
| Individual Status | Not blocked by employer |
| Outstanding Balance | Current owing must allow new advance within limit |

### Advance Limits

| Limit Type | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Maximum Advance | 75% of monthly salary |
| Multiple Advances | Allowed (within 75% total limit) |

#### Example

```
Employee Salary: ₦100,000
Maximum Advance: ₦75,000 (75%)

Scenario 1:
- Takes ₦30,000 advance
- Can still take up to ₦45,000 more

Scenario 2:
- Takes ₦75,000 advance
- Cannot take any more until repaid
```

### Transaction Fee

A 7% transaction fee applies to all salary advances:

| Advance Amount | Fee (7%) | Total Repayment |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| ₦10,000 | ₦700 | ₦10,700 |
| ₦25,000 | ₦1,750 | ₦26,750 |
| ₦50,000 | ₦3,500 | ₦53,500 |
| ₦75,000 | ₦5,250 | ₦80,250 |

### Repayment

- **Automatic**: Repayment is automatically deducted on the 27th
- **Priority**: Advance repayment is deducted before salary credit
- **Full Deduction**: The full amount (advance + fee) is deducted at once

#### Repayment Example

```
Employee: John Doe
Salary: ₦100,000
Advance Taken: ₦50,000
Transaction Fee: ₦3,500
Total Owing: ₦53,500

On the 27th:
- Gross Salary: ₦100,000
- Less Advance Repayment: ₦53,500
- Net Credited to Wallet: ₦46,500
```

### Important Notes

- **No Partial Repayment**: Full advance + fee is deducted on payday
- **Multiple Advances**: Total owing cannot exceed 75% + fee (80.25% max)
- **Resignation**: If you leave while owing, your company will handle collection
- **Company Control**: Your employer can enable/disable this feature

## 9. The 27th - Payday

### Why the 27th?

We chose the 27th because:

- It's before month-end, giving employees time to plan
- It avoids last-day-of-month banking congestion
- It's consistent and predictable
- It allows time for any issues to be resolved before month-end

### What Happens on the 27th

Every 27th of the month, our system automatically:

```

│  STEP 5: Send Notifications to All Parties                  │
